Title: "Learning ES6 Data Manipulation Tasks"

Description:
"This project encompasses tasks aimed at mastering data manipulation in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). Here's a breakdown of the tasks to be completed:

Basic Object List: Implement getListStudents function in 0-get_list_students.js to return an array of objects, each containing id (Number), firstName (String), and location (String) attributes.

Enhanced Mapping: Utilize the map function in 1-get_list_student_ids.js to extract an array of ids from a list of objects.

Filtering: Develop getStudentsByLocation function in 2-get_students_by_loc.js to retrieve an array of objects located in a specific city using the filter function.

Reduction: Create getStudentIdsSum function in 3-get_ids_sum.js to calculate the sum of all student ids using the reduce function.

Combination: Implement updateStudentGradeByCity function in 4-update_grade_by_city.js to return an array of students for a given city with their updated grades.

Typed Arrays: Develop createInt8TypedArray function in 5-typed_arrays.js to generate a new ArrayBuffer with an Int8 value at a specified position, handling errors appropriately.

Set Data Structure: Implement setFromArray function in 6-set.js to convert an array into a Set data structure.

Advanced Set Handling: Develop hasValuesFromArray function in 7-has_array_values.js to determine if all elements in an array exist within a Set.

Set Cleaning: Create cleanSet function in 8-clean_set.js to return a string of Set values starting with a specific string, separated by '-'.

Map Data Structure: Implement groceriesList function in 9-groceries_list.js to return a map of groceries with their quantities.

Enhanced Map Usage: Develop updateUniqueItems function in 10-update_uniq_items.js to update a map's items with an initial quantity of 1 to 100, throwing an error if the argument is not a map.

Weak Link Data Structure: Export a const instance of WeakMap named weakMap in 100-weak.js and export queryAPI function to track the number of times queryAPI is called for each endpoint, throwing an error if the number of queries is >= 5.

These tasks cover a range of ES6 data manipulation techniques, including array operations, set and map usage, and error handling."
